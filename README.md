# .svg File Generator

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of object oriented programming. I was to build an .svg file generator using my knowledge of Javascript, OOP, Inqirer, fs, and Node. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of constructor classes, inheritance, polymorphism and Test Driven Developement with the use of Jest. Understanding SV file structure was also crucial for completing this project. 

A logo.svg generated by the .svg file generator is present in the examples folder.
