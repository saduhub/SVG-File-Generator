## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of object oriented programming. I was to build an svg file generator using my knowledge of Javascript, Object Oriented Programming, Inqirer, fs, and Node. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of constructor classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and Test Driven Developement with the use of Jest. Understanding SVG file structure was also crucial for completing this project. 

A logo.svg generated by the .svg file generator is present in the examples folder.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **Jest Test Suite and Test-Driven Development**: Using Jest as a test suite as well as Test-Driven Development has significantly enhanced my ability to write self-documenting and predictable code. I have become familiar at writing test cases that ensure my applications are robust and reliable. By consistently writing and running tests using Jest, I have been able to increase my proficiency in setting up, configuring, and integrating Jest into my development workflow.
  
- **Node.js and Server-Side JavaScript**: Using Node.js has allowed me to create a server-side run environment for JavaScript. Thus, Node.js allows me to use JavaScript not just for front-end but also for back-end development. Also, I have gained a deeper understanding of the non-blocking I/O model that Node.js employs. This knowledge is useful for creating web applications that can handle several operations at the same time.
  
- **Node Package Manager (NPM) and Dependency Management**: I expanded my knowledge of NPM's intricacies and my proficiency in managing project dependencies. This ensures that my project is built on a solid foundation and remains up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
